## Content

- This is an algorithm for the efficient and reliable estimation of a yield (= percentage of accepted realizations in a manufacturing process under uncertainties).

- For yield estimation a hybrid method combining pure Monte Carlo (MC) with a surrogate model approach based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) is used.

- For yield optimization an adaptive Newton-MC method is used, which is a modification of a globalized Newton method allowing adaptive sample size increase.

- For multi-objective optimization (yield and robust geometry optimization) a genetic algorithm using pymoo.

- As benchmark problems a simple dielectrical waveguide and a lowpass filter (only for estimation) are considered.

## Running the examples

- The main files to run the yield estimation are Run_YieldEst_Waveguide.py (for the waveguide problem) and Run_YieldEst_Lowpass.py (for the lowpass filter problem, respectively).

- The main file to run the yield optimization is Run_YieldOpt_Waveguide.py.

- The main file to run the multi-objective optimization is Run_YieldMOO_Waveguide.py.

## Data origin

- The model of the waveguide comes from Dimitrios Loukrezis (https://github.com/dlouk/UQ_benchmark_models/tree/master/rectangular_waveguides) and is evaluated in Eval_Waveguide.py.

- The model of the Lowpass Filter comes from the CST Studio Suite Examples Library (https://www.3ds.com/de/produkte-und-services/simulia/produkte/cst-studio-suite/) and is evaluated using the Frequency Domain Solver of CST. The results for the S-Parameter are given in Lowpass_data_QoI.py, for the sample in Lowpass_data_sample.py. Eval_Lowpass.py accesses the lists.
